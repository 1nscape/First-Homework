# My first homework

## Description

In week 1 homework, we were required to make some changes to an already existing code, by making it semantic HTML and making the code easier to read, without chaging the function and purpose of the site. It was also a priority to meet accessibility standards. 

## What was done?

Much of the code used <div> which does not fall under the semantic HTML, so changes in the code to meet semantic HTML standards had to be completed. Furthermore, much of the code in CSS was shortened to make it easier to read and to correct. Certain id's created were not used, and few classes were removed as once I have shortened the CSS code, they had no use in the code. All of the changes did not alter the function of the site, but simply make the code easier and more pleasent to read. 
  
## What the site looks like
